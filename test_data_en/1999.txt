plans launch privately financed payload mars last summer held first meeting group founded called mars society aimed building public support human mission mars zubrin mission which calls mars direct differs from nasa reference mission several respects nasa freely admits latched onto some zubrin ideas indeed nasa contracted with zubrin test some those ideas possible incorporation into nasa final plan zubrin most important contribu tion been show that astronauts mars live land startling concept because martian surface colder drier more barren than place earth many resources astronauts supply their lifesupport systems what even more amazing zubrin shown that mars provide fuel astronauts return trip earth nasa mars reference mission relies much possible existing technology bringing down costs latest version reduce total tonnage that lobbed into space from metric tons basic strategy says kent joosten chief engineer exploration office what called split approach differs from apollo missions moon which huge rocket sent everything moon once mars reference mission instead patterned what military commanders battle they call forwa deployment joosten says what means before send your

launch vehicle needs mission ground engineers initially thought they would need mammoth rocket capable delivering metric tons into earth orbit that roughly twice capacity saturn rocket used apollo

medical institute malaria program expert malaria vaccines only years there were those were unequivocal their view that would never able initiate clinical trials understand what behind such pessimism helpful recall medicine history combating disease quinine toxic plant alkaloid first used 1630s treat malaria with some successwhen many side effects make patients even more ill until world the united

manufacture manage outside body once circulating throughout human body vaccines have also been shown elicit production both antibodies cytotoxic lymphocytes ctls killer cells ctls identify directly attack infected cellular targets like those with malaria this capability further encourages researchers about vaccine potential since ctls have past only been stimulated live vaccines further vaccines

broken down into strains pathogenic diseasecausing mycoplasmas often latch onto cells then send signals ordering them behave abnormally distorting their shape proliferating wildly example certain mycoplasma species suppress body immune system while others cellular invaders eventually kill their host cells addition fermentans checkered history that species causes disease first hinted 70s when

when those drugs inside they only able weaken mycoplasma metabolim leaving body immune system eventually kill infection immune system deficient person relapse when stops taking antibiotics maintain

manned exploration would greatly reduced while finding water fire imagination regarding future human explorers many scientists more interested data addressing moon origins nature using reflectors left

station while shuttle docked shuttle gets boost aug this will cost million although using shuttle this function very inefficientthe thrusting must raise orbit both station 100ton shuttle then later lower shuttle equivalent amountit essentially free because relies fuel reserves left from shuttle flight nasa also proposes building propulsion module cost million including shuttle flights required launch service earliest possible launch date this module february without promised progress missions nasa budgeted additional shuttle flights that will haul supplies station nasa insists that each flight will cost only million contrary widely accepted value million launch additionally nasa anticipates outright purchase russian supply missions cost estimate been given most outside experts price single soyuz progress launching about million long range nasa plans encourage development european japanese unmanned supply vehiclesat cost united states price half billion dollars partners under official nasa space station plan year will russian launches support that twice highest launch rate year past decade assumes flights nasa contingency plans what calls minimum russian support scenario which consists three progress soyuz launches year that their entire current production capacity that would reduce station power kilowatts reduce propellant supplies about tons year requiring additional shuttle flights year compensate popular science obtained presentation charts from october nasa briefing contingency plans given mission integration manager keith riley they graphically illustrate quandary that nasa itself because even page titled russian program support assumes that there will continuing russian participation this worstcase scenario russians drop completely however nasa must still depend russia mission control center moscow operate ular 5cence zarya section station somehow nasa expects find persuade russians keep their control activities until launched what they that merely means loss unity us module attached zarya nasa already developed contingency plans loss module during launch they could quickly implemented there spare unit structural test article which could made flightready about year station assembly could resumed mid2000 according riley presentation last october other critical replacement items propulsion module crew return vehicle since there would longterm crew evacuate station prior delivery later astronauts would never stay onboard there would need deliver usbuilt life support module until about that same time nasa painted itself into corner agency handle more delays handle loss russian logistic support flights without delivery zvezda without openended availability semiannual soyuz launches keep bailout capsule attached station nasa faced with threeyear delay leaving permanent crew aboard station making matters worse nasa reported behind schedule readying laboratory module scheduled april launch planned shuttle mission service station been postponed midfebruary because wiring damage discovered shuttle flight last july potential impacts prolonged delay assembling space station staggering they range from lost research opportunities lost international support perhaps even program cancellation nasa realized must price keep russians onboard through launch zvezda then several years soyuz launches russians know only

inches diameter were built with only 5inchdiameter inspection ports ducting built sections small enough through holes like building ship bottle jacobi says which will ready flight until late next year only first several expensive alternatives that nasa develop accommodate delays cancellations promised russian contributions according nasa russians provide station with critical services eight specific functions guidance altitude control life support communications power spacewalk support emergency crew return ground support power provider example russians originally promised supply module called science power platform which would have large solar panels gyroscopes turning station different directions would launched piecemeal aboard three russian zenit boosters would automatically dock station russians soon realized that would heavy their rockets part evenhanded deal which russians promised develop robotic supply vehicle nasa agreed carry into space aboard shuttle flights cost us taxpayers billion russians later told nasa they would able build supply vehicle they kept shuttle flightsin fact nasa added more flights carry additional space hardware russians discovered they could afford launch their deal continued sour turned russians could afford build even though nasa station design depended promised electrical power heatdumping radiators steering gyroscopes nasa considering additional usbuilt photovoltaic power module have entire space station pointed different direction maximize solar power production when united states russia first agreed build station together downside cooperation seemed slight placing station more northerly orbit russians could reach meant that nasa ular 5cence would have accept percent payload performance penalty each halfbilliondollar space shuttle flight station unforeseen problems soon surfaced within year agreeing collaborate station russians began delaying some items backing entirely from others year year list promises shrunk costs have expanded last year news from russia glum promised funding totally dried october nasa reported congress planned handle threatened loss russian elements nasa step costing million already been
