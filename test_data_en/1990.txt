sugamura showed there couple mutagens coffee that also carcinogens other people showed that outside your nice french bread that brown color full mutagens people testing plant products were finding kinds mutagens thinking started change because were getting different picture world change understated describing what became revolution after this bruce ames once proposed that there safety threshold industrial chemicals doing eightybilliondollar pollution experiment with controls ames wrote scientific paper saying molecule mutagen enough cause mutation tested tris chemical being used make

dangers natural carcinogens absolving industrial chemicals from blame increased cancer rates indeed wrote journal there good evidence that there increase cancer modern industrial world behind this drastic turnabout beautifully interlocking theory that ames says hard biochemical facts real world first there nasty stuff nature there between plants animals says ames plant people knew that plants were full toxins kill insects plant does have teeth does have claws away does have immune system plant evolution chemical warfare plants much better chemists than monsanto they been long time every plant thirty forty these chemicals that tend present parts thousand parts million second resulting mutation rates animals that plants enormous then loaded with tumors answer ames says that animal cells have developed their defenses repair like another damaged cells fast possible whole lining your digestive system thrown away every says ames surface your mouth surface your esophagus surface your stomach colon intestine have these stem cells down there they dividing surface cells sloughed tough bruce ames world well starters sees difference between getting dose radiation breathing been

oxygen dangerous breathing that tricky process electrons time trouble because make superoxide hydrogen peroxide hydroxyl radicals they mutagens they dangerous radiation mutagen because splits water produces these same things fact living same getting radiated that conclusion leads sequentially ames opinion about animal cancer tests which lowagain says popular science february copynh matenal because basic chemical principles criticisms that maximum tolerated dose used those tests bothered toxicologists years says their training that everything poison every chemical toxic some dose certain amount aspirin will kill certain amount right major criticism that animal tests done almost exclusively synthetic chemicals natural stuff found nature about half synthetic chemicals tested animals have been found carcinogens ames major effort 1980s been show that these results alarming they seem because nature just malevolent thing computerized data base animal cancer tests with government financing lois gold colleagues have about tests data base they only tell whether chemical tested positive carcinogenicity also measure virulence calculating danger from that value comes ames daily human exposure doserodent potency dose abbreviated herp computing chemical dangers takes estimated daily dose chemical that will cause cancer onehalf group test animals compares that with estimated

higherthannormal risk developing certain common cancersincluding lung colon cancers these exciting discoveries stage cancer they came result long arduous search clarify role genetics disease effort shouldered many investigators beginning 1960s first fruit that search came when scientists undertook audacious experiment experiment began karolinska hospital stockholm doctors there extracted vial full blood from umbilical cord newborn baby rushed airexpress waiting scientists cincinnati young researcher named webster cavenee university cincinnati they sifted through genetic material blood cells quite remarkably found that child inherited mutant gene from mother only months before these scientists determined that this gene when defective could cause rare potentially lethal cancer called retinoblastoma stunning discovery proved first time that inheriting damaged gene could cause cancer cincinnati group knew child risked having gene because cancer struck baby mother when barely months blinding both eyes cavenee immediately relayed word back stockholm that baby inherited mother mutant gene swedish doctors then decided undertake risky procedure when barely five weeks they under general anesthesia more than hour they closely examined retinas both eyes doctors f9und evidence cells just beginning mass into minute dangerous malignant clumps while child still anesthetized doctors directed narrow burst laser light retinas vaporizing cells while leaving rest unharmed cancer been checked feat shook halls medicine never before doctors used genetic test predict accurately emergence cancer before struck turning point genetics well cancer research meant that scientists could peek into jumble human genetic machinery nucleus cell that controls life forecast future doctors already believed that some people inherited tendency develop certain cancers daughters women with breast cancer much more prone same cancer than others cancer specialists were surprised when ronald reagan brother neil were diagnosed with colon cancer within weeks another prior cavenee report involving cancer there little actual evidence that this tendency could transmitted birth there experiment helped trigger race among scientists around world find whether other more common cancers such deadly types that form lungs breast brain might also feat shook halls medicine aturning point genetics cancer research inheritance certain mutant genes race uncovered several such genes many others must still found such genes called tumor suppressors when behaving normally these genes control cell growth genes damaged somehow missing cells normally under control haywire instead grow into malignant mass scientists hope these genetic discoveries craft potent drugs healthy genes tell cells make proteins such enzymes hormones which then carry secondtosecond functions life drug makers hope someday make medicines that mimic proteins manufactured healthy tumorsuppressor genes using them stop even reverse cancer growth some researchers they able block cancer progress replacing damaged genes procedure they call gene therapy popular science september uflyrigh rliji back 1960s when suppressor gene story really starts such bold predictions would have been dismissed mere science fiction back then that obscure pediatrician began research into retinoblastoma pediatrician alfred knudson tall

probe problem basic science when first came across cancer principal responsibility building running department medical genetics them anderson cancer hospital houston knudson solving retinoblastoma mystery kind intellectual mountain climb sought entire scientific career treated many patients developed cancers childhood convinced studying some rare strange diseases would provide crucial clues about cancers especially puzzled rapidity with which childhood cancer evolved most other tumors those that arose adults appeared take decades develop case childhood cancers knudson believed that something perverted cells while still embryo made sense because embryonic cells rapidly dividing especially vulnerable some kind outside interference convinced cancer cancer whatever triggered early onset disease embryo probably acting through same unknown biochemical pathways involved more common lateoccurring forms cancer pathways might more easily studied children because disease course telescoped months instead decades soon after arriving anderson knudson decided study retinoblastoma childhood cancer some cases clearly were inherited stricken child having parent suffered same cancer early childhood cancer while sometimes studied curiosity largely ignored freak occurrence fact until middle last century that victim retinoblastoma survived long enough offspring tumor left untreated narrow burst laser light vaporized cancer cells eventually invades brain fatal prior most children afllicted with died before they were years long before they could pass invention ophthalmoscope made possible doctors look into detect tumor while still small mass rear eyeball confronted with this diagnosis surgeons began eradicating cancer simply removing affected eyes these sightless children began survive into adulthood have their families radually physicians began reporting cases adults been blinded disease having children victimized same cancer presumably gene being passed from parent child gene however surfaced patterns that defied normal laws inheritance sometimes disease would strike half children previously affected adult acting like single dominant gene sometimes hone affected individual children would have disease suggesting gene recessive that copies gene were needed disease arise moreover disease struck oddly sometimes causing growth several tumors both eyes sometimes causing tumors sometimes producing only tumor time knudson began looking disease pattern inheritance complicated that most researchers despaired finding cause ophthalmologists concentrated detecting

under general anesthesia every months first three four years life while examination lifesaving infants inherited disease unnecessary trauma percent more there were other complications about percent retinoblastoma cases were inherited instead they resulted from spontaneous genetic accident that must have occurred developing embryo itself these children disease antecedents earlier generations believed that inherited exact same disease knudson says felt both forms illness were caused damage same gene flash oflogic knudson decided that cancer must result more than mutation upon genetic machinery retinal cells known retinoblasts solution comes from fact that each child inherits copies gene from mother from father knudson realized that cells that became malignant somehow sustained hits inheritance already damaged gene while other came after conception result exposure mutating chemical diet perhaps random error during replication cell genetic works nudson found great satisfaction twohit theory began extrapolating other childhood tumors idea that some people born with genetic predisposition that they more likely than other people develop cancer because they inherit damaged gene says knudson those people inherit gene defect still course develop cancer they must sustain hits somehow both copies gene must hurt knudson twohit theory revolutionary languished backwaters science reason that nobody could prove right wrong because there finding gene itself kind stuck knudson says then anna meadows physician children hospital philadelphia whom knudson recently

might some genetic mutation affecting separate genes that close another each cell contains chromosomes upon which located genes that make entire human genome collection genes scientists developed looking chromosomes under microscope seeing more damaged chromosome shorter than normal meant that sustained some damage missing some genes meadows knudson conducted quick review other cases mental retardation similar that seen little girl found reports that many these retarded children appeared have suffered damage chromosome fact that mentally retarded twoyearold girl also suffered retinoblastoma hinted that retinoblastoma gene might also chromosome knudson felt located site first mutated missing gene that normally resided chromosome gene itself however still eluded help came
