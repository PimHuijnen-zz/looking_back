must specify object with respect which have stopped stopped stop sign then with respect that sign changing position still motion however because earth spins axis rotates around motion with respect other stars thus being rest makes sense only specify with respect what physicists call this defining your reference frame this raises another question there perfect absolute reference frame that stays while everything else moves newton believed that space itself absolute forever static thus could indeed come full stop with respect this absolute space could still watch everything else move physicists call this inertial reference frame newton also held that time absolute should flow same rate everyone newton beliefs about absolute space time into trouble late 19th century experiments

human health amphibians environmental sponges unshelled eggs they exposed whatever might carried hiding passing through pond water tadpoles they waterbreathing vegetarians adults mostly carnivorous landlubbers their moist thin skin vulnerable effects water rain like canaries coal mine frogs provide early warning problems that could eventually affect humans worry about amphibians started long before that nature walk minnesota began midl970s among amphibian experts were finding fewer specimens first case then graduate student needed frogs studies university california berkeley searched known spots frogs sierra nevadas found only relayed problem david wake director unjversity museum vertebrates today credited with being first spread word world thought susan just know find frogs recalls then colleague reported same problem could believe that either says wake took favorite frog placesand right hardly were left other experts amphibians around world were noticing similar problems some species were becoming extinct even they were being studied costa rica startlingly beautiful golden toad australia gastric infographics john mwade aex reardon opular scence ____________ brooding frog whose young develop mother stomach yellowandblack harlequin frog whose lovemaking lasts week gone seems good obvious cause habitat destruction some scientists believe that about there there nothing mysterious says penn state biologist blair hedges down trees frogs anymore another possible villain acid rain hedges colleagues penn state ecotoxicologist bill dunson been monitoring jefferson salamanders across pennsylvania about years seeing graduaj decrease their breeding ponds jeffersons need water that acidic pennsylvania picks pollutants blown from ohio valley that turn rain acidic vinegar rain water accumulates ponds pond water become more acidic than rain itself further soil surrounding ponds more acidic than pond water that means that even airborne acidity somehow could eliminated acid would continue leach into ponds decades least scientists know about acid rainwhat where comes from what damage things clear with broad spectrum chemicals called endocrine disrupters which some developmental biolog ists believe slowly permeating environment including frog ponds these products brokendown plastics pesticides mimic natural hormones most often estrogen
