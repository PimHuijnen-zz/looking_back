suburban jersey time world youngest amateur radio operator thrilled sound voices from halfway around world greatest says that could build things tubes transformers other junk that would talk people today horowitz couple graduate students building cuttingedge electronics that humans sound civilizations outside solar system they already more than three years effort into skysearching project they call beta billionchannel extraterrestrial assay which year behind schedule horowitz does seem impatient this business afford this year marks 35th anniversary first seti experiment project ozma cornell astronomer frank drake trained radio telescope equipped with singlechannel receiver nearby stars reasoning down drake nowfamous equation this estimated billion stars galaxy some fraction must orbited planets with intelligent life there interstellar conversations said drake earth ought able listen despite simplicity project ozma named after author frank baum princess laid groundwork more than searches that have tried with evergreater sophistication prove drake right does matter horowitz that none efforts including have succeeded like everyone seti nderstands difficulty quest most searches like ozma have focused socalled water hole only window electromagnetic spectrum located near wavelength associated with radio emissions from interstellar neutral hydrogen that nearly free background noise these frequencies radio amazingly efficient means communications astronomer estimated that interstellar telegram between civilizations light years apart would cost dollar word when horowitz first heard drake carefully reasoned approach harvard graduate student realized that question alone once province theologianshad moved into domain science search answer that needed radio telescope ingenuity time problem course knowing point telescope what frequency listen imagine tuning every station world hoping catch playing when calling drake himself says there many stars many frequencies dollars always struggling biggest bang buck advantage horowitz beta example that cheap scientific standards about fund searches horowitz relied private backers including carl sagan planetary society even donation from special seti filmmaker steven spielberg creator close encounters that because most astronomers while agreeing that seti probably worthwhile believe merits diverting precious research dollars from other endeavors there issue search radio astronomers have tried approaches some using giant antennas zero star tirrie using lowerpowered dishes sweep hopes cupyn matt getting lucky signal would have strong enough picked easily horowitz says would have cover very narrow range frequencies distinct from natural radio noise such signal speculates would kind acquisition beacon could contain instructions tune actual message what might message like more advanced than wewhich seems likely given technological youth what they talking about going quite incomprehensible says horowitz mixed with this says might more rudimentary oftrepeated message language lesson based simple concepts science given enormous distances involveda signal from even relatively nearby star could take decades reach eartha conversation would have take place generations think dialogue says horowitz think monologue horowitz thoughts however focus message fame would receive found search itself talk about think about mind very much when soldering joints biggest myths about seti that whoever discovers message would keep secretor that they would able horowitz refutes this pointing that first step after discovery confirmation another team radio astronomers immediately call arecibo bonn somebody says have them look keep secret like that national radio observatory with astronomers staffers their spouses their kids their dogs know about greatest discovery history mankind what your chances keeping that instead making worldshaking discovery seti achieved only near misses most famous close call took place ohio state university where seti longestrunning project been underway last years observers there detected signal clearly artifiial that them wrote next data printout transmission lasted only minute never picked again despite hundreds hours listening astronomers astronomer dixon says event become known characteristics intelligent signal convinced intelligent origin know

signals have turned which have eluded confirmation seth shostak california seti institute explains when kind astronomical research telescope unless rained every night have equipment malfunction come back with data with seti says everyone done this come back with positive result paul horowitz this paradox that sets seti apart from other scientific endeavors what horowitz asks search really science like learning something about nature works although learn whole succeeds other words seti gamble aliornothing vegas slot machine with payoff hidden somewhere among stars odds winning incredibly long would anyone spend years trying what keeps people going says frank drake magnificence success drake serves president nonprofit seti institute which occupies collection rented office space silicon valley mind message from extraterrestrials would greatest discovery would change lives future just very dramatic goal there dozen scientists with their eyes that goal easy imagine that seti community would rife with competition instead says drake culture seti people cooperating stimulating encouraging each other there sense competition rivalries well almost none when comes fundingby most difficult part setigood will become strained says horowitz sometimes money like someone else experiment seems getting more press than think deserves university california berkeley bowyer heads program called serendip which uses 4millionchannel receiver attached world largest radio telescope 1000foot dish arecibo puerto rico until couple years serendip receiving nasa funds that changed when congress killed agency seti program since then bowyer chafed amount money publicity sees other seti programs getting says horowitz read about serendip group they doing absolutely terrific work publicity brings headaches including socalled giggle factor caused pervasive misperception that seti somehow linked with enthusiasts seti institute drake says touches nerve ufo around here everybody clenches their fists something fight time feel like losing battle drake cites polls showing that percent american people that ufos from other planets that aliens have landed earth whenever makes public appearance drake close encounter with enthusiasts hope will confirm their beliefs when does says drake they often conclude part government coverup cruising copyngh matenal internet recently drake found himself subject bizarre theory they claim that curator captured alien bodies that have them stored somewhere that dissect them drake laughs have medical training would know dissect frog alone alien congress meanwhile giggle factor helped make seti easy target budgetcutting lawmakers year nasa high resolution microwave survey began operations nevada junior senator emocrat richard bryan mounted oeman

adds money amounted tenth percent nasa budget absolutely impact bud former hewlettpackard vice president raised million donations mostly from four hightech moguls including founding members hewlettpackard microsoft intel also large measure persistence astronomer jill tarter tarter been involved with seti since early 1970s says horowitz incredible sticktoitiveness unbelievable what willing through seti indeed dedicated whole career tarter seems embody bowyer view that science nature both competitive collaborative which seti team likely succeed answers obviously working group that think best chance same time says others view them competitors adding that eager support them both spirit witli funds hopes seti institute will able raise nickel year taxpayers seti allies caught surprise time mobilize support they even noted that some senators participated vote idea what about sen barbara mikulski dmd longtime seti supporter quoted saying giggle factor this bryan press release claimed that singlehandedly stopped great martian chase three days after vote drake seti institute colleagues were already planning comeback strategy within year they created project phoenix most comprehensive expensive seti program ever undertaken goal survey nearby stars next several years this fundraising coup largely efforts institute barney oliver enough money together endowment that would support innovative serious search admission tarter good politics impatient with people point keep with intellectually drake acknowledges abrupt unpolitic adds learning restrain herself getting better that tarter knowledge very existence advanced extraterrestrial civilization would come welcome sign that have chance surviving technological adolescence instead vanishing that this will worth effort says even message only dial tone still tarter deubts will live seti jackpot this could well 1211j copyngilt8d matenal project that granddaughter succeeds says that reason says tarter seti might
