appropriately with hydrazine would enough melt centimeter titanium tubing xactly what happened conjecture depends much liquids mixed where tubing could have melted like butter before popping could

solar panels would have torn away lowgain antenna small mars balloon relay transmitter that should have picked signals from planned us pathfinder mission mars never point toward earth even they ship batteries would soon have gone dead fuel tank blew mars observer shredded either attempts controllers that transmitter back were doomed failure transmitter been when catastrophe experts back home would least have more clues priceless data lost perhaps only more million dollars whole mission lost made decision seven months before launch delay pressurizing tanks glenn cunningham said original plan pressurize five days after launch following usual philosophy making configu94 pular science april ration changes early mission pressurizing needed force fuel oxidizer their tanks toward combustion chamber with system pressurized nitrogen tetroxide would have months gradually leak into lines examining data from earlier planetary missions technicians spotted potential problem we found that pressure regulators leaked past said chief investigator rhoads stephenson result could have been pressure buildup propellant tanks that would eventually have caused them blow viking that problem mars stephenson said waste fuel with extra maneuvers just create some empty space tanks handle overpressure with launch date rapidly approaching team looked options there were tear mars observer apart install additional pressure valves that would prevent pressurization problems would cost mil1ions would delay launch until when next time favorable alignment earth mars occurred other choice delay pressurization until just before ship mars that would mean using residual tank pressure force liquids needed small midcourse corrections that turn would mean that traces hydrazine might left downstream unpressurized system question upstream condensation nitrogen tetroxide come unknown earlier bipropellant systems like coffey said cunningham sighed what know know turned have been damned either sweeping system clean five would work then facing risk slow regulator leak overpressurizing tank those same months overpressurization fact number list potential causes listed coffey board rather than pinpointing slow dribble helium building pressure months board decided that could eliminate possibility that regulator stuck open during those minutes that happened nitrogen tetroxide tank would have blown this would destroy spacecraft scenario according report while unlikely ruled throughout investigation board hampered lack infor mation about those crucial minutes something happen first seconds after nine minutes mars observer been transmitting data then suddenly died moment extinction would have provided vital clues that left investigators with chore examining every possibility59 them were identifiedthen eliminating everything that implausible extremely unlikely meteoroid instance dismissed oneinmillions chance number three among causes that could eliminated malfunction pyrotechnic device that scenario nasa standard initiator used blow open check valves would have ejected backward like bullet that actually happened similar valve designed tested european space agency though never happened with nasa design ejection eliminated because tests late 199q using same manufacturing mars observer devices showed erosion screw threads that held them together none devices failed testing however failed space ejected piece would have traveled only slightly slower than bullet could have punctured propellant tank leading explosion could have destroyed vital electronics before such pyrotechnic devices used again board said differences between valves mars observer valves need understood electronics failure final scenario that coffey investigators could rule spacecraft power supply used several diodes with ultrathin insulation with wiring that raised suspicions permanent short these diodes would render spacecraft useless report said still that short would have occur during silent minutes jolt could there were jolts from pyro firing pressurization sequence there were greater jolts during original launch during midcourse maneuvers correlation with minutes weak weak enough ignore completely internal investigation added loss both spacecraft computers loss both primary backup transmitters list contenders odds such simultaneous failures however remote nasa faces problem what next more titan launch vehicles available duplicate mars observer built from spare parts would heavy smaller rockets given potential problems spacecraft duplicate would good idea under circumstances indeed news conference presenting results naval research laboratory report coffey said reflew mars observer nothing different there high probability would lose again answer prepare simpler spacecraft launch carrying many spare scientific instruments this observer lite spacecraft would launched aboard delta rocket second even smaller craft would sent during next launch window early carrying remaining instruments mike malin camera system would both missions that plan fits with nasa administrator daniel goldin philosophy smaller faster cheaper developing scientific spacecraft space after race august though with concern about sending solo spacecraft interplanetary missions rerunning mars observer mission with overall plans decade even nasa included funds observer lite budget request fiscal which went congress early february probably would select contractor with interplanetary experience build small basic spacecraft feel pretty good about being able just years glenn cunningham says observer electronics spares warehouse jersey available space agency already mars launch planned pathfinder mission that would both lander tiny robot rover planet

rest come from government part from ministry science which pays salaries part from ministry atomic energy which pays materials equipment miscellaneous support kadomstev institute also built larger tokamak t15 experiments this machine have virtually ceased t15 more complex than t10 because uses superconducting coils maintain magnetic field needs cooled liquid helium which must constantly replenished that makes expensive to operate both t10 tokamaks right says kadomstev would take much money about three four million dollars year russian science budget very small percent gross national

fresh ideas physics chemistry mathematics have stupid people russia course united states benefit from many these ideas they cost when asked whether laboratory applied soros grants dianov replied that submitted proposals three four projects that accepted minister saltykov dismisses such thinking essentially sour grapes american scientists also disappointed their grants turned down us national
