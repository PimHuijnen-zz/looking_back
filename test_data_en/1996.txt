chased ecovillage developers plnned build conventional subdivision there subdivision would have housed same number people village buildings yards driveways would have been evenly distributed across landscape ecovillageinstead will place housing parking only acres benefit says bokaer that families that live units will share acres open space completed units will range from including shared land facilities ecovillage planners studied older communities that have survived place long periods they chose their model yoff senegal where five centuries villagers have lived clustered housing immediately surrounded agricultural lands with african wilderness beyond ecovillage will have clustered housing like yoff and first neighborhoodthere will eventually fivewill have duplexes various sizes some close five feet apart first neighborhood under con struction villagers seeking families interested being part second back from road individualfamily units will share common parking instead

instead individual yards ecovillagers will share gardens orchards twoacre community organic farm already place taking advantage natural area ecovillage will also create series interconnected pools that purify water draining from nearby route eventually aquaculture ponds will provide fish village planners tried preserve best agricultural soils farming enhance existing water supply these goals

says philip langdon studied suburban developments states book better place live reshaping american suburb typical suburban zoning places houses distance from retail commercial buildingsmaking necessity with cars come pollution shopping districts with huge paved parking areas houses fronted garages instead congenial porches cars cheap either according figures from american automobile association typical suburban family vehicles which together about percent household aftertax income suburbs also more developed land house people than urban areas because each family separate dwelling yard most yard space devoted growing lawns that inhospitable native wildlife acre more chemicals applied suburban lawns than nation farmland lastly suburbs ideal places socializing although majority americans suburbanites there lack gathering places community life says langdon life more satisfying when together with people percentage americans living suburbs doubled since pedestriansrather than carsare king neotraditional communities such seaside florida panhandle technologies under consideration says walker some people leave group because environmentally pure enough affordable enough compromise community planners decided forgo using photovoltaic panels after discovering that years energy savings would required recoup initial costs installing panels electricity will come from local power grid anticipation future cost reductions community roofs will angled accept solar panels initially ecovillage will also public sewage systems longterm goal community treat waste possible method

simply flopped side used that japan earthquake engineering best world engineer recalled think saying that anymore japan earthquake engineering leading edge most experts believe stark warning earthquakeprone areas throughout world that despite stateoftheart engineering even moderate earthquake like great hanshin cause massive destruction 72magnitude quake that struck kobe 545am january killed more than people caused more than billion property damage year later experts studying quake have gained better understanding what happened kobeand what could happen united states kobe experience shows even moderate earthquake deliver deadly punch when rupturing fault located directly beneath city that spells trouble many us cities this exactly scenario earthquake were strike hayward fault says california structural gineer charles kircher toured kobe just days after quake hayward fault threatens oakland other communities east shore francisco common sense that being closer earthquake more dangerous than being farther away thanks recent earthquakes that have occurred areas blanketed seismic instruments seismologists engineers becoming convinced that shaking close rupturing fault more violent than previously thought what this means city like angeles that there greater threat from moderate earthquake minor faults directly beneath city than from andreas which some miles from downtown shaking right fault really been appreciated says mori scientist pasadena office us geological survey until year nobody paid much attention fault lines neath kobe that mistake squeezed onto threemilewide plain between mountains osaka kobe been called chokepoint japan major highways rail lines honshu japan main island through this narrow corridor were even bullet train

motorcycles scooters drivers used sidewalks avoid expressway debris back eets were worse often impassable even foot older residential sections city were mazes narrow streets littered with rubble collapsed buildings those houses resist typhoons very well says watabe they very weak against earthquakes explains that traditional japanese wooden buildings rely heavy ceramic tile roof resist

earthquake originated about miles from downtown traveled directly underneath city only were quake forces greater than expected near fault line these forces were compounded phenomenon known directivity fault ruptures seismic waves radiate directions point rupture moves along fault seismic waves spreading direction rupture bunched together speed moving rupture close speed which seismic waves travel through ground concentrated pulse seismic energy delivered rupture segment this especially true rupture moves along relatively straight line january northridge earthquake lesser extent hanshin quake angeles lucky quake that originated directly under northridge delivered concentrated pulse energy sparsely populated mountains north kobe lucky makoto watabe structural engineer senior director giant construction company shimizu corp says that directivity effects were clearly recorded seismic instruments kobe notable things about hanshin earthquake that shaking lasted very short time approximately seconds says very intense just what directivity means design buildings being debated kircher member seismology committee structural engineers association california says that horizontal earthquake loads specified california building codes probably accurate miles from fault closer codes probably understate loads kircher says committee recommending that design earthquake load structures very close fault lines doubled problem admits knowing precisely where faults some like andreas have been accurately located many others like fault that rocked northridge ever recognized until they generate earthquake within miles fault line kobe scores low midrise office commercial buildings downtown area partially totally collapsed many collapses were classic examples earthquake failures perhaps most common these what engineers call soft story type softstory collapse seen smaller commercial buildings with several floors offices apartments above shop window garage entrance ground level large opening made first floor more flexible soft than stories above sway building during earthquake then concentrated flexible floor resulting stresses structure could withstand many cases first floor obliterated with upper stories brought down level virtually intact similar failure seen midheight dozens larger multistory reinforced concrete buildings floor building seemingly disappeared with little damage floors above below investigations have typically found that change structure shape building created soft story kobe city hall annex example sixth floor this eightstory building suffered pancake collapse later determined that sixth floor structure composite reinforced concrete wrapped around steel members above sixth floor purely reinforced concrete transition created weak plane that proved fatal building while damage some buildings shocking number buildings without even scratch also surprising tall glass towers without single broken pane stood next piles collapsed rubble beside damaged city annex city hall 32story glassandsteel tower that undamaged became city emergency command center major determining factor building performance proven general buildings performed very well says shimizu watabe watabe explains that there were changes japan building code amount steel reinforcing required concrete columns dramatically increased strengthen structures transferring horizontal forces from o2gmee yngh rliji upper floors into ground code revisions reflected change design philosophy that adopted about same time building codes throughout world under revised codes beams columns designed survive moderate earthquakes elastically bending stretching then napping back their original shape major earthquakes which expected occur only every thousand years structural members designed permanently deform absorb earthquake energy even structure damaged beyond repair this design save lives people might otherwise crushed collapsing building building codes make difference major construction company surveyed buildings built kobe area found that per cent those built before collapsed were badly damaged enter buildings built between figure percent those built since only percent engineers conclude that make japan safer earthquakes emphasis must upgrading older structures kobe only small percentage building stock cur rent codes that says thomas tobin former executive director

fort collins collection admit that many seeds stored laboratory refrigerated vaults were replanted when they should have been many those probably will germinate they dead there might five thousand thousand tropical corn varieties stored vaults says goodman some date back 1950s many 1960s 1970s 1980s potential trouble says samples from 1950s have likely deteriorated point where only about
