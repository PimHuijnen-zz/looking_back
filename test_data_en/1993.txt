pipeline veins arteries membranes used fairly conventional copolymers says rudnick the controlling surface architecture these fibers understanding limitations diffusion across them diffusion important because that what determines exchange substances across membrane think diffusion process which when water water gradually turns brown explains the moves from high concentration become evenly distributed this difference concentrations triggers process diffusion across biohybrid membranes works both directionssome molecules while others proper permeability membrane depends upon what should able cross barrier what should example when working with dopamine parkinson patients membranes have sizeselective pores that enable substances with molecular weight less diffuse capsule growth factor used treat form hemophilia would need larger pores that could accommodate molecules greater molecular weight larger larger pores more things come through rudnick continues including some things like antibodies these immune system proteins range molecular weigh from about just under membrane also selected according type immune system assault adds rudnick example some areas body called immune sanctuaries will react less vigorously implant than other areas cerebrospinal fluid example there lower levels immunoglobulins explains rudnick brain fewer white cells than other areas body because that have more flexibility with membrane when implanting into those areas than were placing them underneath skin abdomen striking optimum permeability were enough researchers also have prevent body
