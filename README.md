# looking_back
Jupyter Notebook that visualizes trends in textual data of freqencies that represent looking back (as in "n years ago") and looking forward (as in "n years from now"). It also saves a sorted list of the trigrams ending in "years ago" (or, with some tweaking, "years from now") to your hard drive.

Input is textual data of the format year.txt, like:

1970.txt  
1971.txt  
1972.txt  
1973.txt
